# Virtual Keyboard using HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/dcode-software/pen/KYYKxP](https://codepen.io/dcode-software/pen/KYYKxP).

This pen comes from my YouTube tutorial video (link: https://youtu.be/N3cq0BHDMOY) which creates a virtual keyboard using vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

I think projects like this are super helpful for learning web development or specifically HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. You don't always need a library or framework to create good looking UI components.
